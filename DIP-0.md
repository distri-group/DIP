# What is a DIP?
DIP stands for Distri.AI Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a design document providing information to the Distri.AI community, or describing a new feature for Distri.AI or its processes or environment. The DIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for its adoption. The DIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

# DIP Rationale
We intend DIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Distri.AI. Because the DIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

However, we also require that, where appropriate, Technical DIPs are also reflected in the protocol's specification, which is the primary source of reference for other developers. The Distri.AI Spec site will in turn point back to the DIPs that have changed some part of the protocol, as well as the DIP's revision history.

For Distri.AI implementers, DIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally, each implementation maintainer would list the DIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
