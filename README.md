# Distri.AI Improvement Protocol
The Distri.AI Improvement Protocol contains the set of fundamental governing principles for the Distri.AI Network. It outlines the vision for Distri.AI and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.

At present, the Distri.AI development path will adopt the following methods: DIP --> Design document --> development and implementation. These documents can be found on our official website or GitHub resources.

# Mission
The goal of the DIP project is to document standardized protocols for Distri.AI clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.



# The  Role of DIPs
Distri.AI Improvement Proposals (DIPs) are the primary mechanism by which the Distri.AI enthusiasts can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the Distri.AI. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

Distri.AI will be a key part of the Solana ecosystem. It can not only provide elastic and scalable computing resources for the entire Solana ecosystem, but also provide friendly decentralized AI applications for other ecological blockchain applications. Currently, DIPS is not very complete. We are gradually soliciting good ideas from the community. Once adopted, we will reward you generously.

# The format of DIPs 
At present, there are no strict format requirements for DIPs management, but we suggest to adopt these parts, such as the purpose of DIP, the simple background of DIP, the idea of DIP, the templet advice of DIP,etc. 

If you intend to output a good scheme for Distri.AI, you can refer to [DIP-0](DIP-0.md)
