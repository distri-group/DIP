### Overview

Apps will always limit certain features to only some users, for example in Distri.AI you will only be able to access your leased computing power device. Add a checking mechanism to the Distri.AI CLI periphery. Only requests that pass the check will be processed by the application. This keeps the vast majority of unauthorised requests out of the application. This will be able to effectively protect user privacy and resource security.

**Motivation**

Distri.AI develops AI computing on decentralised GPU networks with privacy-preserving and data-secure cornerstones. Authentication is used to verify that a given user is who he or she claims to be, and while its not sufficient to protect data, there is no data security without authentication and authorisation.

As a result, we propose a set of standard and Solana-based access control methods for the Distri.AI CLI.

**Stakeholders**

This proposal impacts all members of the Distri.AI community.

### Implementation
Each ***Workspace*** requires a specific ***Token*** for access.

#### Client/Computing power provider
The ***Token*** is automatically generated by the Client upon receiving the computing power order and saved locally. When the Client can confirm that the request object is the purchaser of the current order through signature verification, the client will redirect to the ***Workspace***.

#### Computing power demander
The demander of computing power needs to sign a specific field `workspace/token/{WalletPublicKey}` and submit it to the Client. The Client will perform effective verification on this signature.
